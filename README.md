MatLab implementation of simulations in "Ranging and Light Field Imaging with Transparent Photodetectors"

* main program to execute: main.m.
* Users can toggle the figure variables (e.g. Fig4a, Fig4b_e, Fig3Sb) to generate selected images.
* Within each figure generation code section, below variables can be toggled:
  updateMode: choose if the focal stack camera object will be re-generated.
  complexScene: choose if the two-disk scene or the photorealistic scene will be used.
  reconMode: choose if light field reconstruction will be performed.
